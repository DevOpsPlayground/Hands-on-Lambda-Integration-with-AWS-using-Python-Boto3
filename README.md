# DevOps Playground May 2021
In this session, youâ€™ll learn how to write AWS Lambda functions in Python to interact with S3 and DynamoDB. We will be utilising the SDK for Python, known as Boto3. With Boto3, developers can create, configure, and manage AWS services through code. 

During this playground you will:
- Set up AWS Lambda to interact with other AWS services such as S3, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch
- Set up a trigger on S3 invoking the Lambda to take a CSV file and parse it to DynamoDB
- Configure permissions to allow the services to interact
- Utilise AWS CloudWatch
